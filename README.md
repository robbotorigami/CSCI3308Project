Title: CU Scheduler

Description: CU Scheduler will be a utility for planning course schedules across multiple years in order to acheive academic goals. It would allow for data on course requirements to be easily seen and utilized while determining what courses to take.

Vision Statement: To make educational goals reachable and understable

Motivation: Many of the CU tools for managing your schedule are hard to navigate, and seperated from each other. This utility would make it easy to navigate the sea of information to effectively plan your college career

Risks:
 - Difficulty of accessing class information
 - Storing all data may take a lot of server space
 - Lack of experience with web-based data managment
 
Mitigation Strategy:
 - Plan to utilize CUs existing infrastructure to present information to users for simplicity
 - If data storage becomes a bottleneck, can only store partial data sets, and fetch the rest on a user by user basis
 - Utilize SQL to give us a well used platform with plenty of examples
List of Requirements:
 - As a student, I want to view information about what classes are being offered in a semester, so that I plan my schedule
 - As a student, I want to see all of my classes laid out chronologically in a week, so that I can see whether or not I like my schedule
 - As an advisor, I want students to be able to easily share their planned schedule, so that I can understand their plans
 - As a student, I want to see information about class dependencies/prerequisites, so that I can understand whether my schedule is acheivable
 - As an administrator, I want the website to pull information from existing infrastructure, so that I can avoid manually updating information
 - As a student, I want to see relevant information about the class, so that I can plan my workload around the difficulty of the class
 
Methodology: We plan to utilize an Agile methodology

Project Tracking software: we intend to use Trello, and potentially Github issues
